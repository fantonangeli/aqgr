Welcome to the Registry of Farmed Types of Aquatic Genetic Resource. This is a
prototype version of the Registry developed and maintained by FAO. It provides
you with access to searchable databases of initial information on primary and secondary
farmed types of the more than 600 farmed aquatic species across ten taxonomic groups.
The prototype includes some information from over 90 countries.

<br>
<br> The information is compiled through country contact persons on aquatic genetic
resources (AqGR) and Member Country National Focal Points (NFPs). It allows users
to analyse the diversity of farmed types of AqGR at national, regional and global
levels including the characteristics and status of these farmed types from both
development and conservation perspectives.
<br><br> The current registry includes information on {{totalSpecies}}
species, from {{totalCountries}} countries including {{globalInfoData.totalFtypes}}
primary and {{totalSftypes}} secondary farmed types.
<br> This page summarises the data currently contained within the Registry. Data
can also be viewed in separate pages focusing on <a href="{{worldLink}}">Development of AqGR</a>,

<a [routerLink]="['/policies']" routerLinkActive="router-link-active">Policies, Institutions and Capacity</a>for the management of AqGR.
