            At this stage of its development the prototype Registry questionnaire does not include questions related to national policy, institutions or capacity with the exception of one question related to controls on access to AqGR. The data related to this question is covered in the first two graphic items. The remaining graphic items presented on this page are based on data collected from Country Reports as part of the preparation of the Report on the State of the Worldâ€™s Aquatic Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture published in August 2019. This information refers to legislation and policy that relates to or impacts upon AqGR including controls on their use and exchange. Information is also provided on the numbers and focus of institutions involved in Research and Education related to AqGR.
