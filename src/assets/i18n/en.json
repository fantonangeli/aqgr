Both wild relatives and farmed types of AqGR represent a key resource for the future development of aquaculture and need to be conserved. At the same time, aquaculture and farmed AqGR, particularly where they are non-native, can represent a risk to biodiversity. Disruption to biodiversity can occur through habitat disruption brought about by aquaculture, by disease introduced from cultured species and through genetic contamination from escapes or deliberate introductions of farmed AqGR into the wild.<br /><br />This page summarizes information contained in the Registry relating to the risks and controls associated with farmed AqGRand alsosummarizes the <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> conservation resources (protected areas, live and <em>in vitro</em> gene banks) for AqGR which exist in member countries. Graphic items on native and none native species and the risk status of species are based on data entered into the Registry by countries. Graphic items relating to conservation programmes (protected areas and gene banks) are based on data collected from country reports as part of the preparation of the Report on the State of the World&rsquo;s Aquatic Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture published in August 2019.",
