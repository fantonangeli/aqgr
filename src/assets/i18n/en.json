It provides you with access to searchable databases of initial information on primary and secondary farmed types of the more than 600 farmed aquatic species across ten taxonomic groups.  The prototype includes some information from over 90 countries. \r\n\r\n            <br>\r\n            <br>\r\n            The information is compiled through country contact persons on aquatic genetic resources (AqGR) and Member Country National Focal Points (NFPs).
